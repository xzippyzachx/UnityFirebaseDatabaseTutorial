# UnityFirebaseDatabaseTutorial

These are the example projects used for a YouTube tutorial on the Firebase realtime database in unity 
Unity Version: 2020.1.17f1

**Important!**
Due to the Firebase SDK's being too large to include in the repo. You will need to install the required Firebase SDK's into these projects to begin using them.

Follow these steps to add the Firebase SDK's to your project:
1. Get the required Firebase SDK modules here: https://developers.google.com/unity/archive (Auth & Realtime Database)
2. Download the newest .unitypackage's
3. Then rightclick your assets folder (in unity) and import package > Custom package > .unitypackage file
